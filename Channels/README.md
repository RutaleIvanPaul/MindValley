# MindValley Channels Activity Recreation-Test
##### What parts of the test did you find challenging and why?

  - Coming up with test cases
        - Considering that there was little logic processing the app was really doing, it was quite challenging to come up with multiple test cases that made meaning.
  - Matching the UI with the design specifications
        - It is quite a demanding design and concept. It requires a lot for one to actually match it as required.

##### What feature would you like to add in the future to improve the project?

  - Search Bar: For users to quickly access content without having to scroll through everything
  - Browse by <Any Field>: For users to be able to browse through the content basing on more than catrgories. For example: Browse by author
